To add a feature to cancel the deployment if the pipeline is not deployed after a certain time,
you can use CircleCI's job-level timeouts in your project's `config.yml` file.

You can set the timeout for each job using the `timeout` key. For example, to set a timeout of 10 hours (or 36,000 seconds) for a job called `deploy`,
you can add the following code to your `config.yml` file:

```
jobs:
  deploy:
    timeout: 36000
    # your deployment steps
```

If the job does not complete within the specified time, CircleCI will automatically cancel the job and mark the build as failed.

To cancel the entire pipeline if the deployment job is not completed within the specified time, 
you can add a `when` condition to the subsequent jobs in your workflow. For example, 
if you have a job called `test` that should only run if the `deploy` job is successful, you can add a `when` condition like this:

```
workflows:
  build_and_deploy:
    jobs:
      - deploy
      - test:
          when: << pipeline.parameters.deploy.result == 'success' >>
          # your test steps
```

In this example, the `test` job will only run if the `deploy` job completes successfully. 
If the `deploy` job times out and is canceled, the `test` job will not run, and the entire build will be marked as failed.
